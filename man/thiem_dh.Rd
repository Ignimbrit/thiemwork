\title{Use the Dupuit-Thiem equation to calculate the drawdown in a well}
\usage{
thiem_dh(Q, h0, r_well, kf, dh_search_min = 0.001, dh_search_max = h0)
}
\arguments{
\item{Q}{the pumping rate of the well in mÂ³/s}

\item{h0}{the natural height of the water column above the aquitard (in absence of a well) in m}

\item{r_well}{the radius of the well}

\item{kf}{the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer in m/s}

\item{dh_search_min}{the minimum possible drawdown of the well to be considered in m. Defaults to 0.001m == 1mm}

\item{dh_search_max}{the minimum possible drawdown of the well to be considered in m. Defaults to \code{h0}}
}
\value{
the drawdown of the well in m
}
\description{
\code{thiem_dh} is a thin wrapper around
\code{\link{thiem_h}} that returns the drawdown of the well instead of
its water coloumn height, which is usually more useful.
}
\examples{
# first example
thiem_dh(Q = 0.001, h0 = 10, r_well = 0.08, kf = 10^-4)
