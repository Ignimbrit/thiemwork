\title{Use the Dupuit-Thiem equation to calculate the pumping rate of a well}
\usage{
thiem_Q(h1, h2, r1, r2, kf)
}
\arguments{
\item{h1}{the height of the water column above the aquitard at monitoring well 1 in m}

\item{h2}{the height of the water column above the aquitard at monitoring well 2 in m}

\item{r1}{the distance from the pumping well to the monitoring well No 1 in m}

\item{r2}{the distance from the pumping well to the monitoring well No 2 in m}

\item{kf}{the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer in m/s}
}
\value{
the pumping rate in mÂ³/s
}
\description{
\code{thiem_Q} is an implementation of the widely used
well equation by Dupuit-Thiem FOR UNCONFINED AQUIFERS.
