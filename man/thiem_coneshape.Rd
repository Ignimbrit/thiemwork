\title{Use the Dupuit-Thiem equation to calculate the cone shape of a well}
\usage{
thiem_coneshape(
  x,
  Q,
  h0,
  r_well,
  kf,
  dh_search_min = 0.001,
  dh_search_max = h0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the distance in m from the well whre h is to be calculated}

\item{Q}{the pumping rate of the well in mÂ³/s}

\item{h0}{the natural height of the water column above the aquitard (in absence of a well) in m}

\item{r_well}{the radius of the well}

\item{kf}{the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer in m/s}

\item{dh_search_min}{the minimum possible drawdown of the well to be considered in m. Defaults to 0.001m == 1mm}

\item{dh_search_max}{the minimum possible drawdown of the well to be considered in m. Defaults to \code{h0}}
}
\value{
hydraulic potential \code{h} as m above aquitard in distance \code{x} to the well
}
\description{
\code{thiem_coneshape} calculates the hydraulic potential
\code{h} at a given distance \code{x} from a pumping well
